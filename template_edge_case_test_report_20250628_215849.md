### Stress Testing Results
- Large dataset chart generation performs within acceptable time limits
- Template switching maintains consistent performance across multiple operations
- Memory usage remains stable during intensive chart generation operations

### Error Handling Validation
- System gracefully handles invalid file paths and missing templates
- Empty or malformed data inputs are processed without system crashes
- Concurrent access to template resources operates safely

### Scalability Assessment
- Multiple presentation generation scales linearly with reasonable resource usage
- Template parsing and brand configuration extraction remain efficient
- Chart generation performance is suitable for production workloads

## Recommendations

### Production Readiness
1. **System Stability Confirmed**: All stress tests pass with acceptable performance
2. **Error Handling Robust**: Edge cases are handled gracefully without system failures
3. **Memory Management Effective**: Resource usage remains within acceptable bounds

### Performance Optimization Opportunities
1. Consider caching parsed template configurations for faster switching
2. Implement chart generation pooling for high-volume scenarios
3. Add monitoring for memory usage in production environments

### Quality Assurance
1. Regular stress testing should be incorporated into CI/CD pipeline
2. Performance benchmarks should be established for regression testing
3. Error handling coverage should be maintained for new features
